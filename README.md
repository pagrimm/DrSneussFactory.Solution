**By Peter Grimm, 08.07.2020**

## Description

Weekly independent project for Epicodus, an MVC web application to track engineers and the machines they are qualified to service for a factory. Designed to showcase my knowledge and skills with MySQL and the Entity Framework using many-to-many relationships.
