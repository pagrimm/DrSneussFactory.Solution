**Weekly Independent Project for Epicodus**  
**By Peter Grimm, 08.07.2020**

## Description

Weekly independent project for Epicodus, an MVC web application to track engineers and the machines they are qualified to service for a factory. Designed to showcase my knowledge and skills with MySQL and the Entity Framework using many-to-many relationships.

## Specifications
User Stories
* As the factory manager, I need to be able to see a list of all engineers, and I need to be able to see a list of all machines.
* As the factory manager, I need to be able to select a engineer, see their details, and see a list of all machines that engineer is licensed to repair. I also need to be able to select a machine, see its details, and see a list of all engineers licensed to repair it.
* As the factory manager, I need to add new engineers to our system when they are hired. I also need to add new machines to our system when they are installed.
* As the factory manager, I should be able to add new machines even if no engineers are employed. I should also be able to add new engineers even if no machines are installed
* As the factory manager, I need to be able to add or remove machines that a specific engineer is licensed to repair. I also need to be able to modify this relationship from the other side, and add or remove engineers from a specific machine.
* I should be able to navigate to a splash page that lists all engineers and machines. Users should be able to click on an individual engineer or machine to see all the engineers/machines that belong to it.
